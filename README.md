<p>Created this app during Spotify's one night long hackathon Hackout Out West 2016, which reached the finals and was presented on a stage during Way Out West. The idea is that a user can log in with his or her Spotify account and swipe on nearby people's playlists who are also using the app. A server is however not implemented so the playlists are generated from one single account. All playlists that are swiped on are currently added to the favourites tab, since an implementation of deciding what direction they are swiped hasn't been added yet. In the favourite tab, long-clicking on a playlist adds it to your Spotify account. Happy swiping!</p>
